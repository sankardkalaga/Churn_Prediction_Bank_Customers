# Churn_Prediction_Bank_Customers
An international bank would like to investigate the customer leaving rate by identifying the people are likely to leave the bank. Supervised classifications were trained/tested on the dataset consists of at least 10000 customers with 13 features and one label column (exited or not). Pre-processing of the data set, exploratory data analysis along with data visualization was performed. Built the statistical Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes and Logistic regression models and calculated their accuracy metrics. Performed the prediction on the test dataset. Confusion metrics and their associated true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives was identified. Built the ROC curve and compare all the models in terms of accuracy metrics. The best accuracy was obtained with the Naïve Bayes model (83.29%).
